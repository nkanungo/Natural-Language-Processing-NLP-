"**Dear Oliver,**  Is this important business book one that you have overlooked? Gates and Buffett didn’t …  Many writers and observers wax lyrical on the über success of men like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, and though there are many factors at work that have contributed to their success, many identify their ongoing dedication to learning as a key attribute. A case in point, which Gates recounted for the Wall Street Journal, takes place more than 20 years ago, when Gates, upon meeting Buffett for the first time at what one can only assume was a powerhouse gathering, didn’t indulge in an exchange on boardroom topics but instead, rather tellingly, inquired as to Buffett’s favorite business book, perhaps knowing that this one simple query would not only reveal – upon its reading – many of Buffett’s own philosophies, but that it would also expose him to new concepts of his own.  To the question, Buffett answered John Brooks’ Business Adventures; to the books credit, Gates says it remains his favorite, too.  The collection of Brooks’ New Yorker essays included inBusiness Adventures [http://www.getabstract.com/ShowAbstract.do?dataId=22665&l=1&utm_campaign=NewsletterEN_BillGates&utm_source=getAbstract&utm_medium=email&esid=108159353] use pertinent case studies, such as how the Ford Motor Company misread the market for its Edsel, and how copy machines fuels Xerox Corporation’s fast growth, to offer valuable insights and demonstrate pivotal moments that shaped the modern US economy. The personalities integral to the tales are painted as vivid characters, and the valuable messages one gathers from this read are delivered with understated wit, for an easily digestible commentary on the human side of corporate history and its trials.  [http://www.getabstract.com/ShowAbstract.do?dataId=22665&l=1&utm_campaign=NewsletterEN_BillGates&utm_source=getAbstract&utm_medium=email&esid=108159353]Business Adventures [http://www.getabstract.com/ShowAbstract.do?dataId=22665&l=1&utm_campaign=NewsletterEN_BillGates&utm_source=getAbstract&utm_medium=email&esid=108159353]  Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street   John Brooks   Browse our business library [http://www.getabstract.com/AbstractList.do?action=abstractList&sumGroup=1&l=1&utm_campaign=NewsletterEN_BillGates&utm_source=getAbstract&utm_medium=email&esid=108159353] for further business must-reads.

"* Your Services Agreement and Privacy Statement made clearer *  As part of our effort to improve your experience across our consumer services, we’re updating the Microsoft Services Agreement and the Microsoft Privacy Statement. We want to take this opportunity to notify you about these updates.  The Microsoft Services Agreement will cover most of Microsoft’s consumer online services, including Xbox Live, Bing, MSN, Skype, OneDrive, Outlook.com and Microsoft account. You can see the full list [here]. The Microsoft Privacy Statement also covers most of Microsoft’s consumer products and services. http://microsoft.microsoft.com/Key-119602.D.Q1Vt.C.K2.-.J6fbs9  ******************************  Simplicity – Many of our customers use more than one Microsoft service, and have agreed to many sets of terms and privacy policies. To make it easier to use multiple services, we’ve brought together these documents into a single agreement and a consolidated privacy statement that cover most of our consumer services.  Privacy – Our longstanding commitment to privacy has not changed. We remain committed to protecting your data, being clear about how we use it, and putting you in control. For example, we do not use the contents of your email, chat, video calls, documents, photos, or voicemail to target advertising to you. And as you’ll see when you read the Microsoft Privacy Statement, we offer a range of tools that enable you to make decisions about what data we collect. Additionally, we have launched a new [privacy dashboard] that makes it easier for you to make choices about how we use your data. http://microsoft.microsoft.com/Key-119602.D.Q1Vt.D.K2.-.JcRd6b  Transparency – We are using straightforward language so our terms of use and Microsoft Privacy Statement are easier to understand. In addition, we’ve put key privacy information all in one place, so you no longer have to cross-reference several documents to understand the big picture. While this consolidation eliminates redundancies and simplifies the structure of the information, we continue to provide service-specific details to allow you to make informed choices about how you use our services. We’ve also added some additional privacy information about new features and functionality we’ll soon roll out, like those you’ll see on Windows 10.  ******************************  The updates will take effect on August 1, 2015. If you continue to use our services after August 1, 2015, you agree to the updated terms. If you do not agree, you can choose to discontinue use of the services and close your Microsoft account before August 1st. If you are an Xbox Live subscriber, you will be prompted soon to accept the terms when you log in to Xbox Live on your Xbox One, Xbox 360, or at Xbox.com. If you are a parent or guardian, you are responsible for your child or teenager’s use of Microsoft services, including purchases.  Thank you for using Microsoft services.  ******************************  [Microsoft Privacy Statement] http://microsoft.microsoft.com/Key-119602.D.Q1Vt.F.K2.-.Jp0hrd  [Microsoft Services Agreement] http://microsoft.microsoft.com/Key-119602.D.Q1Vt.G.K2.-.nJpLxYQ  [Frequently Asked Questions] http://microsoft.microsoft.com/Key-119602.D.Q1Vt.H.K2.-.nJh8vhP  ******************************  [Microsoft] http://microsoft.microsoft.com/Key-119602.D.Q1Vt.J.K2.-.nJ60rZM  Microsoft respects your privacy.

"Hello,  We’re writing to tell you about some upcoming changes to the presentation of your AWS tax invoices.   AISPL customers expressed their preference to have a consolidated tax invoice accessible to their payer account. As a response to this customer need, beginning April 1, 2019, all accounts associated with your Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTID) will receive a consolidated tax invoice. If you belong to a Consolidated Billing (CB) family, this consolidated tax invoice will be accessible only to the payer account.    • If you don’t share your GSTID with any other account, then the tax invoice associated with your account’s usage will be accessible to you AND the payer account from the 'Bills' section of the Billing & Cost Management Page.   • If you share your GSTID either with the payer account or any other linked account within the same Consolidated Billing (CB) family, then you will not have access to your account’s tax invoice and you will have to obtain a copy of the tax invoice from the payer account.   Please note that AISPL tax invoices were previously generated at the linked account level and the tax invoice was only accessible to the account that generated the usage.  In addition to this, the tax invoice and credit memo templates that you will be receiving starting in April 2019 will include some enhancements. AISPL is changing the invoice and credit memo ID formats to reflect the financial year and the distinction between a regular tax invoice and credit memos by updating the current ""AISPL –xxxxxx"" notation to ""AIN1819xxxxxxxxx"" and ""ACN1819xxxxxxxxx.""  If you have any questions, please create a case with https://aws.amazon.com/support .  Sincerely, Amazon Web Services  Amazon Web Services, Inc. is a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc.

This allows the amount receivable (as lumpsum) by an NPS Subscriber at the time of exit completely tax free. For example, if a Subscriber decides to exit from NPS at the age of 60 with an accumulated corpus of 1 crore, the maximum lumpsum withdrawal (60% of total corpus) i.e. 60 lakh can be withdrawn tax free.  Benefits of EEE  If we compare this with earlier scenario (only 40% as lumpsum withdrawals were tax free), a Subscriber would be saving more than 7 lakh in case of 30% tax bracket (including surcharge).  Total Corpus: 1 Crore Earlier Scenario Current Scenario  Annuity Purchase :  40% (mandatory) Tax Free Tax Free  Lumpsum Withdrawal : 60% (maximum) 20% of the Corpus is taxable i.e. 20 lakh Tax Free  Total tax deduction 7 lakh (30% tax bracket) Tax Free  How much corpus one can accumulate in NPS  Starting Monthly Contribution ₹ 2,500  Annual Increase 8%  Returns generated 9.5%  Investment Period 30 Years  Accumulated Corpus ₹ 1.15 Crores  If a Subscriber starts with monthly NPS contribution of ₹ 2,500 and it increases at 8% annually, in 30 years, more than ₹ 1.15 crores pension corpus can be generated with returns of 9.5%.  Instructions to open Transaction Statement  our statement is protected by a nonviolence for your security.To open the statement, please enter 8 characters nonviolence as per the instructions given below:  First four characters: The first four alphabets of your ""First Name"" in lower case.

"**Dear Oliver,**  Is this important business book one that you have overlooked? Gates and Buffett didn’t …  Many writers and observers wax lyrical on the über success of men like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, and though there are many factors at work that have contributed to their success, many identify their ongoing dedication to learning as a key attribute. A case in point, which Gates recounted for the Wall Street Journal, takes place more than 20 years ago, when Gates, upon meeting Buffett for the first time at what one can only assume was a powerhouse gathering, didn’t indulge in an exchange on boardroom topics but instead, rather tellingly, inquired as to Buffett’s favorite business book, perhaps knowing that this one simple query would not only reveal – upon its reading – many of Buffett’s own philosophies, but that it would also expose him to new concepts of his own.  To the question, Buffett answered John Brooks’ Business Adventures; to the books credit, Gates says it remains his favorite, too.  The collection of Brooks’ New Yorker essays included inBusiness Adventures [http://www.getabstract.com/ShowAbstract.do?dataId=22665&l=1&utm_campaign=NewsletterEN_BillGates&utm_source=getAbstract&utm_medium=email&esid=108159353] use pertinent case studies, such as how the Ford Motor Company misread the market for its Edsel, and how copy machines fuels Xerox Corporation’s fast growth, to offer valuable insights and demonstrate pivotal moments that shaped the modern US economy. The personalities integral to the tales are painted as vivid characters, and the valuable messages one gathers from this read are delivered with understated wit, for an easily digestible commentary on the human side of corporate history and its trials.  [http://www.getabstract.com/ShowAbstract.do?dataId=22665&l=1&utm_campaign=NewsletterEN_BillGates&utm_source=getAbstract&utm_medium=email&esid=108159353]Business Adventures [http://www.getabstract.com/ShowAbstract.do?dataId=22665&l=1&utm_campaign=NewsletterEN_BillGates&utm_source=getAbstract&utm_medium=email&esid=108159353]  Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street   John Brooks   Browse our business library [http://www.getabstract.com/AbstractList.do?action=abstractList&sumGroup=1&l=1&utm_campaign=NewsletterEN_BillGates&utm_source=getAbstract&utm_medium=email&esid=108159353] for further business must-reads.

"* Your Services Agreement and Privacy Statement made clearer *  As part of our effort to improve your experience across our consumer services, we’re updating the Microsoft Services Agreement and the Microsoft Privacy Statement. We want to take this opportunity to notify you about these updates.  The Microsoft Services Agreement will cover most of Microsoft’s consumer online services, including Xbox Live, Bing, MSN, Skype, OneDrive, Outlook.com and Microsoft account. You can see the full list [here]. The Microsoft Privacy Statement also covers most of Microsoft’s consumer products and services. http://microsoft.microsoft.com/Key-119602.D.Q1Vt.C.K2.-.J6fbs9  ******************************  Simplicity – Many of our customers use more than one Microsoft service, and have agreed to many sets of terms and privacy policies. To make it easier to use multiple services, we’ve brought together these documents into a single agreement and a consolidated privacy statement that cover most of our consumer services.  Privacy – Our longstanding commitment to privacy has not changed. We remain committed to protecting your data, being clear about how we use it, and putting you in control. For example, we do not use the contents of your email, chat, video calls, documents, photos, or voicemail to target advertising to you. And as you’ll see when you read the Microsoft Privacy Statement, we offer a range of tools that enable you to make decisions about what data we collect. Additionally, we have launched a new [privacy dashboard] that makes it easier for you to make choices about how we use your data. http://microsoft.microsoft.com/Key-119602.D.Q1Vt.D.K2.-.JcRd6b  Transparency – We are using straightforward language so our terms of use and Microsoft Privacy Statement are easier to understand. In addition, we’ve put key privacy information all in one place, so you no longer have to cross-reference several documents to understand the big picture. While this consolidation eliminates redundancies and simplifies the structure of the information, we continue to provide service-specific details to allow you to make informed choices about how you use our services. We’ve also added some additional privacy information about new features and functionality we’ll soon roll out, like those you’ll see on Windows 10.  ******************************  The updates will take effect on August 1, 2015. If you continue to use our services after August 1, 2015, you agree to the updated terms. If you do not agree, you can choose to discontinue use of the services and close your Microsoft account before August 1st. If you are an Xbox Live subscriber, you will be prompted soon to accept the terms when you log in to Xbox Live on your Xbox One, Xbox 360, or at Xbox.com. If you are a parent or guardian, you are responsible for your child or teenager’s use of Microsoft services, including purchases.  Thank you for using Microsoft services.  ******************************  [Microsoft Privacy Statement] http://microsoft.microsoft.com/Key-119602.D.Q1Vt.F.K2.-.Jp0hrd  [Microsoft Services Agreement] http://microsoft.microsoft.com/Key-119602.D.Q1Vt.G.K2.-.nJpLxYQ  [Frequently Asked Questions] http://microsoft.microsoft.com/Key-119602.D.Q1Vt.H.K2.-.nJh8vhP  ******************************  [Microsoft] http://microsoft.microsoft.com/Key-119602.D.Q1Vt.J.K2.-.nJ60rZM  Microsoft respects your privacy.
